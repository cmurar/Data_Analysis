# Data_Analysis

GunsDeathAnalysis: In this project,I have been working with Jupyter notebook in order analyzing data on gun deaths in the US. The dataset which I have been analysing came from FiveThirtyEight, and can be found "https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/guns-data". I tried to answer different questions and to find certain patterns regarding guns rate per gender,location, age etc. At the end of the python script I have used matplotlib to visualize these patterns.
